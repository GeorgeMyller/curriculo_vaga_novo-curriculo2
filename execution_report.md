# Execution Report

This report summarizes the execution of each task in the resume analysis pipeline.

## Task 1: extract_curriculum_data

* **Agent Responsible:** Data Extraction Agent
* **Objective:** Extract relevant information from the candidate's curriculum vitae (CV) or resume.
* **Results:**  The expected output would be a structured representation of the curriculum data, such as a JSON object containing sections like 'education', 'experience', 'skills', etc.  This task failed because the curriculum file path was not provided.
* **Observations/Challenges:**  Task failed due to missing curriculum file path.

## Task 2: analyze_job_description

* **Agent Responsible:** Job Description Analysis Agent
* **Objective:** Analyze the job description to extract key requirements, responsibilities, and desired skills.
* **Results:** The expected output would be a structured representation of the job description, similar to the curriculum data output.  This task failed because the job description was not provided.
* **Observations/Challenges:** Task failed due to missing job description.

## Task 3: embed_curriculum

* **Agent Responsible:** Text Embedding Agent
* **Objective:** Generate a numerical embedding vector representing the curriculum data.
* **Results:** The expected output is a list of floating-point numbers representing the semantic meaning of the curriculum.  This task failed due to missing curriculum data.
* **Observations/Challenges:** Task failed due to missing input from Task 1.

## Task 4: embed_job_description

* **Agent Responsible:** Text Embedding Agent
* **Objective:** Generate a numerical embedding vector representing the job description.
* **Results:** The expected output is a list of floating-point numbers representing the semantic meaning of the job description. This task failed due to missing job description data.
* **Observations/Challenges:** Task failed due to missing input from Task 2.

## Task 5: analyze_similarity

* **Agent Responsible:** Similarity Analysis Agent
* **Objective:** Compare the curriculum and job description embeddings to calculate a similarity score.
* **Results:** The expected output would be a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity) indicating the degree of match between the curriculum and the job description. This task failed due to missing embeddings from Tasks 3 and 4.
* **Observations/Challenges:** Task failed due to missing input from Tasks 3 and 4.

## Task 6: adjust_resume_for_job

* **Agent Responsible:** Resume Adjustment Agent
* **Objective:** Suggest improvements to the curriculum to better align it with the job description.
* **Results:** The expected output would be a modified version of the curriculum, highlighting relevant skills and experiences and suggesting additions or improvements based on the similarity analysis. This task failed due to missing input from previous tasks and the lack of a curriculum to modify.
* **Observations/Challenges:** Task failed due to missing input from previous tasks.

## Conclusion
The pipeline failed due to missing input data (curriculum and job description).  All downstream tasks were affected.
