# Report Generation Report

This report documents the process of generating the `execution_report.md` file.

The primary goal was to create a comprehensive summary of the execution of each task in the resume analysis pipeline.  However, several challenges were encountered:

1. **Missing Curriculum Data:** The path to the curriculum file was not provided, preventing the extraction of curriculum data (Task 1).
2. **Missing Job Description:**  The job description (either URL or text) was not provided, preventing the analysis of job requirements (Task 2).

Due to these missing inputs, the entire pipeline failed.  The `execution_report.md` file was generated to document this failure, describing the expected output of each task and the reasons for failure.  It highlights the dependency of each task on the successful completion of preceding tasks.

Future improvements include implementing robust error handling and input validation to prevent such failures.  The system should gracefully handle missing input data and provide informative error messages.
