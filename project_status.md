# Resume Optimizer - Project Status and Changes

## Fixed Issues

1. **PDFSearchTool Configuration**:
   - Removed unsupported `task_type` parameter from PDFSearchTool configuration in `src/crew.py`.

2. **Job Description Handling**:
   - Created a custom `JobDescriptionTool` that can handle both URL and text inputs.
   - Updated the job_analyzer agent to use this tool.

3. **Streamlit Integration**:
   - Created `streamlit_runner.py` to bridge the Streamlit app with the CrewAI system.
   - Updated the Streamlit app to accept both .tex and .pdf files.
   - Added options for job input as either URL or text.
   - Added PDF compilation option for the optimized resume.

4. **Task Configuration**:
   - Updated the `analyze_job_description` task to handle both URL and text inputs.

## Remaining Issues

The codebase has multiple validation errors in `src/crew.py` related to the CrewAI decorator-based configuration. These errors are primarily related to the validation system of the IDE and don't necessarily indicate runtime errors.

### Next Steps:

1. Test the streamlit application with the updated code.
2. If errors persist during runtime, consider the following:
   - Make sure all required dependencies are installed with the proper versions.
   - Check that environment variables (.env file) are properly set.
   - Consider refactoring the crew.py file to use the non-decorator approach if the decorator approach continues to show errors.

## Conclusion

The main TypeError related to `task_type` has been fixed, and we've added significant improvements to handle both URL and text inputs for job descriptions, as well as support for different resume file formats.

For testing, run:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
